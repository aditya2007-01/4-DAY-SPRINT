1) What I understood today?
  
First I learnt how to load blocks in two different databases and then compare them which verifies the hash value of block. I also learnt how to how to detect divergence.

Features Implemented:
✅ Block-by-block comparison - Iterates through all blocks
✅ Hash comparison - Detects hash mismatches
✅ Data comparison - Identifies data differences
✅ Timestamp comparison - Finds timestamp discrepancies
✅ PrevHash comparison - Validates chain linkage
✅ Missing block detection - Identifies blocks on only one node
✅ Divergence point - Pinpoints where chains fork
✅ Sync percentage - Calculates how synchronized nodes are
✅ Actionable recommendations - Provides next steps
✅ Comprehensive summary - Clear, detailed diff report
